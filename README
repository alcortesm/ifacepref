    1. Ifacepref

Ifacepref is a kernel module for 2.6 linux kernels.



    2. External data is needed to compile and test!

That's right, you will need about 1,5 GB of external data to compile
and test ifacepref the way I like. Of course none of these external
data is included in this distribution. You will have to get it
yourself.

That way I keep this distribution small and avoid the inclusion of
external software in the distribution and in my version control
system.



  2.1 What external data I need and how do I get it?

To compile the module you will need a full kernel source tree.

To test the module the way I do, you will need an UML kernel and
some root filesystems to boot it.

I have write some scripts to help you/me to get all these things.
They are under the extdata/ directory. You will need to edit the
CONFIGUREME file before executing those scritps. Then just execute
each of the scripts in alphanumerical order.

If you are trying to compile an older kernel in some new distributions
you will need to copy /usr/include/sys/user.h to
/usr/include/asm/user.h.



    3. Compilation

To compile a 2.6 linux kernel module you will need a compiled linux
kernel source tree. I'm going to use UML as the compilation architecture
as the testing and debugging of the kernel module is much safe and easier.

When configuring the kernel compilation remember to adapt it to your
CPU and to include hostfs support.

See doc/00-uml-compilation.txt for instructions about how to compile
such a kernel. If you edit the CONFIGUREME file and used my extdata/
scripts to generate all the needed external data, you will only need
to invoke "make" to compile the module.



    4. Test the module

  4.1 UML rootfs creation

See doc/01-uml-rootfs-creation.txt for instruction about how to create
the rootfs for the UML systems. If you used my extdata/ scripts you have
already create a working rootfs.


  4.2 Launch the rootfs

Just launch it with the "run-uml.sh". There is only one user "root"
with no passwd.


  4.3 Test the module

You will find the module and the load and unload scripts at:

/mnt/host-tmp/ifacepref.ko
/mnt/host-tmp/ifacepref_load
/mnt/host-tmp/ifacepref_unload
