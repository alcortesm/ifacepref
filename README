    1. Ifacepref

Ifacepref is a kernel module for 2.6 linux kernels.

    2. Compilation

To compile a 2.6 linux kernel module you will need a compiled linux
kernel source tree. I'm going to use UML as the compilation architecture
as the testing and debugging of the kernel module is much safe and easier

See doc/00-uml-compilation.txt for instructions about how to compile
such a kernel.

    2.1 UML rootfs creation

See doc/01-uml-rootfs-creation.txt for instruction about how to create
the rootfs for the UML systems.

    3. Test environment
